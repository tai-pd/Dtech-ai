The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive frontend application replicating  with enhanced design and equivalent features. Initially, the focus was on a pixel-perfect clone with mock data, including a multi-level navigation sidebar. After resolving a minor import error, the AI delivered a functional teaser. Subsequent user requests iteratively expanded the application: detailed product pages, then enhanced product pages mirroring 's depth (requiring data restructuring and bug fixes for literal newlines), followed by robust error checks and content verification. Blog post detail pages were added, then product categorization, and finally, a homepage redesign to group products by category. A  was created. The most recent work involved setting up a frontend API service layer with mocked, delayed responses using Axios and React Suspense for loading states, adding back buttons to detail pages, and is currently focused on implementing sub-product detail pages as hyperlinked children from main product pages, following the established API service architecture.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a pixel-perfect clone of  for an industrial electrical equipment website. The clone should have an improved design, maintain all original features, and be in Vietnamese. Initial requirements included mock product data and a multi-level navigation sidebar for product categories.
The application has since evolved to include:
1.  **Detailed Product Pages**: Each product needs a dedicated page with full specifications, images, and information. These pages were later enhanced to be more formal and comprehensive, aligning with 's structure, including multiple product categories and detailed content sections with images.
2.  **Blog Post Details**: Implement individual pages for blog posts accessible from the Bài viết hữu ích section.
3.  **Product Categorization**: Products should be split and navigable by specific categories: Thiết bị đóng cắt, Biến tần - Inverter, Thiết bị bù CSPK, Đo đếm - Giám sát - Điều khiển, Vỏ tủ - Phụ kiện - Dây cáp, Thiết kế và Lắp đặt Tủ điện, Tư vấn Giải pháp.
4.  **Homepage Structure**: The homepage should display products grouped by their respective categories.
5.  **Build Guide**: A  file detailing how to build and run the source.
6.  **API Service Layer**: Frontend should use Axios to call a fake API (mocked backend responses with a 1-second delay) for data fetching, with React Suspense for loading states.
7.  **Navigation**: Implement back buttons on product and blog detail pages.
8.  **Sub-Product Detail Pages**: Product detail pages should have hyperlinks directing to children sub-product detail pages, following the new API service architecture.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React**: Frontend framework.
-   **FastAPI**: Backend framework (though mostly frontend work has been done).
-   **MongoDB**: Database (backend, not yet extensively used for application features).
-   **Shadcn UI**: Component library for UI elements.
-   **React Router DOM**: For client-side routing.
-   **Axios**: HTTP client for API calls.
-   **React Suspense**: For declarative loading states with data fetching.
-   **Mock Data**: Local JavaScript files simulating API responses.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack structure with React for the frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB for the backend.



Key files and their importance:

-   : The central file managing the application's routing. It has been updated multiple times to include routes for home (), products (), blog posts (), and product categories (), and integrates the new Suspense components.
-   : Initially held all mock data but has been refactored. It now contains general mock information, with product and blog-specific data moved to dedicated files.
-   : A newly created file storing structured, detailed mock data for all products, including product lines and images, mirroring the dtech.vn product page format. This file has been edited multiple times to fix syntax issues and expand product entries.
-   : A new file holding mock data for blog posts.
-   : The main landing page, updated to display products grouped by categories and to link to blog posts. It was also fixed for a missing  icon import.
-   : Manages the multi-level product category navigation, updated to make categories clickable and navigate to .
-   : The primary component for displaying detailed product information, designed to be formal and comprehensive with support for product lines and associated images. It includes a back button.
-   : Displays the content of individual blog posts, now includes a back button.
-   : Displays products filtered by a specific category.
-   : A new  directory containing  (an Axios instance for fake API calls with a delay) and specific service files (, , ) that simulate fetching data from a backend.
-   , , : Components introduced to handle loading states and errors with React Suspense.
-   : Document detailing API contracts and integration strategy for future backend development.
-   : Provides instructions on how to set up and run the application.

<pending_tasks>
- No pending tasks were explicitly discussed or deferred. The AI engineer is actively working on the latest request.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently implementing sub-product detail pages. The user requested that product detail pages (e.g., ) should contain hyperlinks directing to their children sub-product detail pages (e.g., ). This implementation needs to follow the newly established API service layer architecture, meaning data for sub-products will be fetched via a fake API call with a 1-second delay, leveraging React Suspense for loading states. The work started with modifying  (Chat Message 229) and planning the detailed coding for this feature. This will involve updating existing components like  to render these hyperlinks and creating a new component for the sub-product details, potentially updating routing in  as well.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the sub-product detail page component and update  to link to it.
